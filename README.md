To inspect the modules and install the requirement 
Hi friends
If you are dealing with several clients and you must present your models through many meetings, this baby spider may help you :
When the model will not work without its requirement. Using this piece of code, you can protect your model's performance against any unforeseen situations.

How to use: 
lib_list: includes all Module/ Libraries you need in your project
lib_name: use it if you need to use abbreviation instead of the Module name like pandas and pd 

if the module has not been installed, it will be installing dynamically using: os.system('pip install %s' % library)

I wish you have a very joyful day 
Happy Codding 
Cheers
